step 0 import dataset
	imported datasets of humans and dogs
	dog_files, dog_targets
	human_files
step 1 detect humans
	face_detector
step 2 detect dogs
	uses resnet-50 model pretrained on imagenet dataset
	has bunch of categories, we only use 151-268 which are dog breeds
	used as a dog detector (ignoring breeds)
step3 cnn from scratch to detect dog breeds
	created a model from scratch, got 1,8% accuracy, which is better than 1/133 (random)
step 4
	transfer learning from VGG16, downloaded bottleneck features pre-extracted, just added
	our softmax layer for categorization
	Test acc = 45% when identifying breeds
